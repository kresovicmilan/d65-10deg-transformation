function [zscores,conf]=rankorder(raw_scores,labels)

% RANKORDER: Calculates z-scores and confidence intervals from
% rank order experiment data.
%
% Assumes that a 'proportion-of-preference' matrix of all possible
% comparisons is implied by the rank order data, and that z-scores
% can be calculated from this matrix as for a pair comparison experiment.
%
% See Cui, C. (2000) 'Comparison of two psychophysical methods for
% image color quality measurement: paired comparison and rank order'
% IS&T/SID 8th Color Imaging Conference, 222-227
%
% Prepares 'frequency-of-preference' matrix from raw rank order data
% Calls paircomp.m to calculate z-scores and confidence interval
% from the frequency-of-preference matrix
%
% Calls ploterror.m to display results as error bars with confidence intervals
%
% Example: [zscores,conf]=rankorder(raw_scores,labels,order)
%
%   raw_scores is an nxk matrix where n is the number of stimuli
%   and k is the number of observers
%
%   labels is a vector containing the names of the stimuli being compared
